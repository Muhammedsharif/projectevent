    <p>An essay describing certain events that happened to you or other people is called an event essay. It doesn’t matter if the situation you’re writing about happened to you or not since your overall task does not change. This task can be a challenging one. You need to include the illustrative details of the event to make the readers feel like they’re experiencing the event firsthand. It needs to be more than a mere description of an event and contain elements of the narrative style.</p>

    <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116).This handout will help you understand how paragraphs are formed, how to develop stronger paragraphs, and how to completely and clearly express your ideas.</p>
